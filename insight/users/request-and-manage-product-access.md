The Insight Platform unites InsightVM, InsightAppSec, InsightIDR, InsightConnect, and Rapid7Services. This united location provides centralized authentication and user management, which makes it easy for platform users to request product access and for Platform Administrators to manage access requests.

From the Insight Platforms, users can:

* [Request Product Access](https://insight.help.rapid7.com/docs/product-access#section-request-product-access)
* [Request a Free Trial](https://insight.help.rapid7.com/docs/product-access#section-request-a-free-trial)

In addition to requests raised by existing platform users, any requests to add a new user to your company account or to grant access to an external user (such as Rapid7 Support), will need to be reviewed by a Platform Administrator who can [grant or reject access](https://insight.help.rapid7.com/docs/product-access#section-grant-or-reject-access-and-trial-requests) from the User Management page.

## Manage access requests
Requests are then processed by Platform Administrators who can grant or reject access from the User Management page.

## Grant or reject access and trial requests


Platform Administrators manage Platform users' product access and trial requests and any requests to add a new user to you company account or to grant access to an external user (e.g. Rapid7 Support).

**To grant or reject requests:**

1. Go to the **User Management** page.
2. Click **Requests** in the upper right corner. "New User" requests are displayed first by default. If you need to view and manage Product Access, Product Trial, or External User requests instead, you can go to the relevant tab.
